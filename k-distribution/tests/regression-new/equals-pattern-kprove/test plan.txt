Tests that need to pass if :=K, :/=K would be implemented without [owise]:
    1. :=K wrapped in a function in definition module, over symbolic argument.
    2. :/=K wrapped in a function in definition module, over symbolic argument.

Tests expected to fail because :=K, :/=K operators are not supported outside extended definition module:
    3. :=K straight in side condition of spec rule, over concrete arg.
    4. :/=K straight in side condition of spec rule, over concrete arg.
    5. :=K straight in side condition of spec rule, over symbolic arg.
    6. :/=K straight in side condition of spec rule, over symbolic arg.
